# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a fast and efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to rapidly extract needed information from diverse data sources. The system prioritizes speed and efficiency while maintaining accuracy in information retrieval and generation, supporting both file-based and external data sources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to query information from multiple data sources quickly, so that I can get relevant answers without waiting for slow processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL return relevant information within 2 seconds for typical queries
2. WHEN the system processes a query THEN it SHALL search across all configured data sources simultaneously
3. WHEN multiple data sources contain relevant information THEN the system SHALL rank and prioritize results by relevance score

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure multiple data source types, so that the RAG system can access information from files, databases, and APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring data sources THEN the system SHALL support file-based sources (PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX)
2. WHEN configuring data sources THEN the system SHALL support database connections (SQL, NoSQL)
3. WHEN configuring data sources THEN the system SHALL support REST API endpoints
4. WHEN a data source is added THEN the system SHALL validate the connection and index the content
5. IF a data source becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with remaining sources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to understand context and provide accurate responses, so that I get meaningful answers rather than just raw data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a query THEN the system SHALL use semantic search to find contextually relevant information
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL synthesize information from multiple sources into coherent answers
3. WHEN information is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide clarifying questions or multiple interpretations
4. WHEN citing sources THEN the system SHALL include references to the original data sources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient indexing and caching, so that the system maintains fast response times even with large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data is added THEN the system SHALL incrementally update indexes without full reprocessing
2. WHEN frequently accessed information is requested THEN the system SHALL serve results from cache within 500ms
3. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize active data sources and cache hot data
4. WHEN data sources are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh relevant indexes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want a simple API interface, so that I can easily integrate the RAG system into existing applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the system THEN it SHALL provide a REST API with standard HTTP methods
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL support both synchronous and asynchronous query processing
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL support configurable authentication methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor system performance and data source health, so that I can ensure optimal operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL provide metrics on query response times and success rates
2. WHEN data sources have issues THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide health status indicators
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN it SHALL provide alerts and diagnostic information
4. WHEN reviewing usage THEN the system SHALL track query patterns and popular data sources
