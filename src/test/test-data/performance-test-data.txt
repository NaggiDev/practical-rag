Performance Testing Data for Fast RAG System

This file contains sample content specifically designed for performance testing scenarios.

Query Processing Performance:
The system is designed to handle typical queries within 2 seconds and cached queries within 500ms. Performance testing should verify these requirements under various load conditions.

Concurrent Query Handling:
The system must maintain performance when handling multiple simultaneous queries. Load testing scenarios should include:
- Light load: 5 concurrent users
- Medium load: 15 concurrent users  
- Heavy load: 30 concurrent users
- Stress load: 50+ concurrent users

Memory Management:
Proper memory management is crucial for sustained performance. The system should:
- Maintain stable memory usage under load
- Implement efficient garbage collection
- Use connection pooling for external resources
- Cache frequently accessed data appropriately

Response Time Requirements:
- Typical queries: < 2000ms
- Cached queries: < 500ms
- Complex queries: < 3000ms
- Health checks: < 100ms

Throughput Expectations:
- Minimum 10 queries per second sustained
- Burst handling up to 50 concurrent queries
- 95% success rate under normal load
- 90% success rate under heavy load

Resource Utilization:
- Memory increase < 100MB during load tests
- CPU utilization should remain reasonable
- Network connections properly managed
- File handles properly closed

Cache Performance:
- Cache hit rate > 50% for repeated queries
- Cache warming for popular queries
- Proper cache invalidation on data updates
- Memory-efficient cache storage

Error Handling:
- Graceful degradation when sources fail
- Proper error reporting and logging
- Circuit breaker patterns for failing sources
- Recovery mechanisms for temporary failures

Monitoring and Metrics:
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Query success and failure rates
- Cache hit rates and effectiveness
- Data source health and availability
- System resource utilization

Load Testing Scenarios:
1. Sustained load over extended periods
2. Burst traffic followed by normal load
3. Mixed query types and complexities
4. Concurrent access to cached data
5. Memory pressure testing
6. Network failure simulation
7. Data source failure scenarios

Performance Benchmarks:
- Baseline performance with single user
- Scalability with increasing concurrent users
- Performance with varying data source counts
- Cache effectiveness under different patterns
- Recovery time after system stress

Quality Assurance:
- Response quality maintained under load
- Source attribution accuracy preserved
- Confidence scores remain meaningful
- Error messages remain informative

This content provides comprehensive test data for validating system performance under various conditions and load patterns.
